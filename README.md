**Specifications and Description of the Code**

This code implements a simple Library Management System using C programming language. The system allows users to perform various operations such as adding books, issuing books to users, returning books, searching for books by different criteria, modifying book information, and displaying the available books and user information.

The code consists of several functions and structures to handle different aspects of the library management system. Here are the main components of the code:

1. **Structures:**
   - `struct Book`: Represents the information related to a book, including its code, name, author, genre, and status.
   - `struct User`: Represents the information related to a user, including the issue number, user name, book code, issue date, and return date.

2. **Global Variables:**
   - `struct Book B[MAX_BOOKS]`: Array of Book structures to store book information.
   - `struct User U[MAX_USERS]`: Array of User structures to store user information.
   - `int bookCount`: Keeps track of the number of books in the system.
   - `int userCount`: Keeps track of the number of users in the system.

3. **Functions:**
   - `AddBook()`: Allows the user to add a new book to the system by providing details such as the book code, name, author, and genre.
   - `IssueBook()`: Handles the process of issuing a book to a user. The user provides the book code, and if the book is available, the system records the user information and updates the book's status.
   - `ReturnBook()`: Manages the return process of a book. The user provides the issue number, and the system records the return date and updates the book's status.
   - `Search()`: Enables the user to search for books based on different criteria, such as the book's name, author's name, or genre.
   - `ModifyBook()`: Allows the user to modify book information such as the book's name, author, or genre by providing the book code.
   - `DisplayBooks()`: Displays the details of all the available books in the system.
   - `DisplayUsers()`: Displays the details of all the users who have borrowed books from the library.
   - `main()`: The main function that provides a menu-based interface for the user to interact with the library management system. It repeatedly prompts the user for their choice and calls the corresponding functions based on the selected option.

The code uses standard C library functions such as `scanf`, `fgets`, `strcpy`, and `strcmp` to handle input, string manipulation, and comparison operations.

Overall, this code provides a basic implementation of a library management system with functionalities for adding books, issuing and returning books, searching for books, modifying book information, and displaying information. However, it does not include features like data persistence or user authentication, which can be added as extensions to enhance the functionality and security of the system.
